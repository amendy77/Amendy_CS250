## 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

It seems like this is a skill that requires practice to become proficient at. All kinds of modifications can be applied through numerous tiny, straightforward releases as long as there is a channel of communication available with the end user. With user stories, the "Who?," "What?," and "Why?" questions are asked, which helps to simplify customer demands.
   1. **Who** is this change for? 
   2. **What** does the user want to accomplish?
   3. **Why** is this change needed?

## 2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I believe I now have the skills I need to improve my comprehension of project management in a variety of contexts after learning about agile. In terms of development, I believe that organization is essential, and agile methodology offers a way to be both flexible and adaptive in addition to being organized. Development teams can regularly meet end-user goals because they are not constrained by time limitations and place a greater emphasis on value-based development. In my upcoming initiatives, I want to use software tools like Github, Jira, and Azure. Furthermore, I've added planning poker and daily stand-up meetings to my "favorites" list of development tools. Agile helps focus attention on minor tasks so that at the end of the project, you have a stable product. It takes the overwhelming sensation out of major development projects. According to a proverb, "Slow and steady wins the race!"

## 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

This is a lesson I acquired after attending a full-stack development bootcamp, and I believe it to be very significant. A team is made up of a wide variety of individuals. Many thoughts will differ, but it's crucial to keep in mind that you're all part of the same team and have the same objective. Who is a better coder or has more experience is not relevant to this discussion. Getting a product delivered is the aim. Since Agile markets itself as a very flexible process, developers must also be flexible. Members of a team must be able to accept differences in opinion and be receptive to ideas that differ from their own. As the team lead for my development project during the bootcamp, I made sure to include everyone on the team and to give them a voice, regardless of whether we agreed or disagreed with their ideas. I believe that fostering relationships and boosting team morale inside the team require trust. Personal development is crucial since growth cannot continue without experience.
